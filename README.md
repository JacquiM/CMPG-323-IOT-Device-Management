This appsettings.json file contains the connection string and I have excluded the file during my commit to my repository for security purpouses.  <br />

## Please take note!<br />
Continuous commits had been done on the repository that I had forked. After completing my project on my development branch and merging with main branch, I realised that I shouldve copied the project to my own repository. I have now done this and will share screenshots to show the Initial commit on my forked repository along with the link to this repository just as proof that I had been working on this project for some time and did not rush to finish.  <br />
